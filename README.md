#  DP-Address-Project 
*This project was done for Decision Point Healthcare Solutions:* https://decisionpointhealth.com 

Command line tool for proccessing stream/batch address data for validation, standardization and two-way geocoding. Provides an internal interface for connecting too and implementing third party services to process address data and produce desired output data. 

## Notes: 
   **Third Party Services Used**
   - Third Party Forward Geocoding and Address Valdiation Service: SmartyStreets (https://smartystreets.com) 
   - Third Party Reverse Geocoding Service (though forward geocoding implemented for use here as well): OpenCageData (https://opencagedata.com)

   **Implementation Details**
   - These third party services are interchangable with other services so long as their implementations (**src/services/...**) reside
      in classes that inherit from the *AddressService* abstract class (**src/models/address_service.py**) e.g. 
      *SmartyAddressService* does all but reverse geocoding, which *OpenCageAddressService* handles, and both inherit 
      from *AddressService*
   - All data processing done inside these third party implementations of *AddressService* classes is done in terms of the *Address* 
     objects (**src/models/Address.py**)
   - All input/output of address objects is handled by utililites(**src/utilities/..**)
   - Designed to allow for running address data through multiple rounds of processing by composing functionality from two different services    or within the same service (see **src/main_batch.py** & **src/main_batch.py** )

## Program Usage: 

first cd into src directory: **dp-provider-address/src/**

#### For Batch CSV Input: 
Running the following example commands should work as is if set up above is completed correctly,
resulting in sample output to '/dp-provider-address/sample-input-output/out.csv' based on the 
sample input file and options selected. **program arguments**:
-  ```--config```  configuration file (see sample_config.cfg)
-  ```--infile```  input csv batch file (see sample-input-output dir)
-  ```--outfile``` output csv batch file (see sample-input-output dir)
-  ```--options``` options for processing input data (see below)

      
   ##### Batch Address Validation and Forward Geocoding: option 0 #####
   ```  
   python3 main_batch.py --config ../sample_config.cfg --infile '../sample-input-output/sample_address_input.csv' --outfile '../sample-input-output/out.csv' --options 0
   ```
   ##### Batch Address Validation Only: option 1 #####

## Details on Third Party Use and Program Behavior:

### Validation with Smarty Streets: 

#### Important Details:

If Smarty Streets finds a valid match on an address string, the API will return a list of candidates with address formatted data,
components, metadata, and analysis. For incorrect/malformatted addresses for which Smarty Streets is still able to find a match, as well as for ones which are already valid without changes, this program grabs the formatted address delivery line 1 and line 2 of the top candidate match that the API can find to provide a validated, standardized address as follows. 

   ```
   [address line 1 (i.e. number - street - specific details)], [address line 2 (i.e. city - state - zip+4)] 
   ```
The lookup parameters by default are set to return a candidate only if smarty streets is very confident in its match. This program chooses strictly the candidate in which Smarty's API is most confident. If it can't find confident matches, it returns no candiates, meaning the address is invalid. In both cases though, the API also returns an analysis of the input address, and an option to allow for less stringent validation, which could be helpful moving forward..

***NOTE:*** Smarty Streets is very good at only returning addresses if they are valid. However, There are a non-neglible number 
of seemingly valid addresses that are marked as Invalid by smarty streets (seems around %2-3). For these it seems that 
SMARTY API has trouble parsing out the address components for particularly long( with long building names) or specifically 
formatted addresses, and is not confident in its matches. Potential solutions included in next steps section. 
Here are a couple example problem inputs with no smarty candidates returned but which are valid. 

- **5453 HIGHWAY 2, PRIEST RIVER ID 83856**
- **8390 HIGHWAY 51 NORTH 101, MILLINGTON TN 38053**
- **LIFESPAN THERAPY 118 MEDICAL DRIVE, CARMEL IN 46032**
- **HILLTOWN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER - SCHOOL-BASED PROGRAM 12 LITTLEVILLE ROAD, HUNTINGTON MA 01050**
- **1401 N WINDING BROOK LOOP, PALMER AK 99645**

#### Batch Behavior:
If smarty streets is able to find a candidate, this program returns **"TRUE"** in the **is_valid** column of output and returns the above standardized address of the top candidate in the **corrected_address** column. 
This happens *EVEN IF THE INPUT ADDRESS IS ALREADY CORRECT*. Otherwise **is_valid** 
is **"FALSE** and **corrected_address** is the empty string. 

#### Stream Behavior: 
If an address string is found to be valid, the same type of standardized address as is in **batch** above is returned 
*EVEN IF THE INPUT ADDRESS IS ALREADY CORRECT*. Otherwise a string saying the input address string is invalid is returned. 

### Forward Geocoding with Smarty Streets:

#### Important Details:
Smarty Streets Validates and Forward geocodes in one step, geocoding only after address has been validated. 

#### Batch Behavior:
After address is validated, populates **latitude**, **longitude** csv column with closest coordinates tha could be found to input address. If address could not 
be validated or coordinates not found, those columns will contain the empty string.

#### Stream Behavior: 
After input address string is validated, a string containing coordinates returned. Otherwise a 
string saying the input address string is invalid is returned. 

### Reverse Geocoding with Open Cage: ###

#### Important Details:
Given an coordinate set, Open Cage (and nearly all reverse geocodoers) will try to match the the coordinates to the nearest, most specific address down to the street number so address formatting may vary.
For example, If it can't find a specific location, it will return the street, and then the city etc... 
If there is no match it will return nothing. 

#### Batch Behavior: 
Given an lat, long batch, the most specific address found will be output to the **address** column, otherwise returns the empty string **""**. 

#### Stream Behavior: 
Given input coordinate string, returns string the most specific address found, string saying the input coordinare string is invalid is returned. 

            
## Next Steps: 
 
### Solve False Invalid Address Outputs (address marked invalid when its really valid): ### 
(see details in validation with smarty streets section for more info on why this needed )
- **Multi-Service Script Composition Solution:**
    - Add a parameter to **batch_main.py** called --invalid_list that 
               when given a file name, produces a csv of input addresses found to be
               invalid and their index in the original input csv.
     - Compose calls to this program to run address validation again but now on 
               this narrowed down invalid list and with a different service (open cage or other), 
               in order to double check problem inputs. If they are found to be wrongly 
               marked invalid, update original input csv. 
- **Address Parsing Script Compostion Solution:**
   - Add a parameter to **batch_main.py** called --invalid_list that 
               when given a file name, produces a csv of input addresses found to be
               invalid and their index in the original input csv file.
   - Use open source address parser to break invalid addresses into components
               and feed that input back into smarty streets ( so it can validate more 
               effectively, and some of these address parsers are up to 99% accurate in breaking
               address into compoenents) .If they are found to be wrongly marked invalid, update 
               original input csv. 
               (https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal)
- **Tweak and Further Eplore Smarty Address Parameters** 
   - More specifically, tweak lookup parameters to make criteria for address validation 
      less stringent, and return less false invalids. Or, dive deeper in the analysis returned on input addresses for which no 
      match was found. 
- **Try Another Service: (hopefully as simple as creating another address class)**
   - Map Based Service: Smarty Validates addresses based on the USPS database of deliverable addresses, 
              whereas google uses mapping data to place an address string as accurately as it can on a map. 
              Google (or other map focused services) do this to give you directions there accurately, 
              but it doesn't really care if the address itself is valid, as long as it maps correctly 
              location-wise. Though not strictly validation, this type of lookup potentially could turn out to be a better fit for DP's use cases.
   - Another Validation service: There are multiple other enterprise level validation services using 
              the USPS database, but I could find no indication that they are any better than smarty, 
              and most they don't include trials or pricing so it was hard to compare - but still might 
              be worth looking into. 

### Future Changes in Outputted CSV Formatting or Specific Formatting of Standardized Addresses: 

- Future changes in how the program rights out True, False, and NULL values into the output csv can be changed with the constants at the top of the **src/utililities/batch_io.py** file. Ideally these would be made program inputs to **main_batch.py**
- Future changes to standardized address output format should be done by changing the get_standardized_string()
  method in the Address class in **src/models/address.py** . 
  
### Turn Into Available Microservive with Python Flask: 

- Make a flask API that depending on request type and params will call this program so that it correctly 
returns the service the user is looking for, and allow for composition of script calls as mentioned in 
the **Solve False Invalid Address Outputs** section above. 

- This will allow this program to be exposed to multiple  end users and make it more dynamic 

### Testing: 
- **Integration testing:** check that different needs and use cases are adaqautely provided by this service
                       both for data and product teams. 
- **Unit Testing:** Most of the functions will check for invalid input and but all cases on ever function 
                have not been tested for.
